You want to decide whether you should drive your car to work or take the train.
You know the one-way distance from your home to your place of work, and the fuel efficiency 
of your car (in miles per gallon). You also know the one-way price of a train ticket. 
You assume the cost of gas at $4 per gallon, and car maintenance at 5 cents per mile. 
Write an algorithm to decide which commute is cheaper.

Your answer in pseudocode below:

double distance;
double fuelEfficiency;
double gasPrice;
double trainTicket;
Double carMaintenance;

Double GasCost = distance * (gasPrice *  fuelEfficiency);
Double commute cost = distance * carMaintenance = GasCost;

if(trainTicket > commuteCost), Write "it is cheaper to commute"
else if(trainTicket < commuteCost), write "it is cheaper to use the train"
else, write " they are the same price"
